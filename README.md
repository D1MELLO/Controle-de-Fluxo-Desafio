# 🔁 Java Flow Control Challenge

This repository contains a Java coding challenge focused on **flow control structures**, proposed during the **Java Beginners Track** on [Digital Innovation One (DIO)](https://www.dio.me/).

## 📚 About

The purpose of this challenge is to practice the use of **conditional statements** (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and **loops** (`for`, `while`) in Java by implementing a method that simulates a bank operation based on user-defined parameters.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA 
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D1MELLO/Controle-de-Fluxo-Desafio.git
2. Open it in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Run the main method located in:
   ```bash
   src/com/dio/desafio/Main.java

## 📌 Features
Use of conditionals to control execution flow

Simulated logic based on input values

Clean and organized structure following Java best practices
